  abstract = "Long sequencing reads are information-rich: aiding de novo
              assembly and reference mapping, and consequently have great
              potential for the study of microbial communities. However, the
              best approaches for analysis of long-read metagenomic data are
              unknown. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of bioinformatics
              tools is hindered by a lack of long-read data from validated
              samples with known composition.We sequenced 2 commercially
              available mock communities containing 10 microbial species
              (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards) with Oxford Nanopore
              GridION and PromethION. Both communities and the 10 individual
              species isolates were also sequenced with Illumina technology. We
              generated 14 and 16 gigabase pairs from 2 GridION flowcells and
              150 and 153 gigabase pairs from 2 PromethION flowcells for the
              evenly distributed and log-distributed communities, respectively.
              Read length N50 ranged between 5.3 and 5.4 kilobase pairs over
              the 4 sequencing runs. Basecalls and corresponding signal data
              are made available (4.2 TB in total). Alignment to
              Illumina-sequenced isolates demonstrated the expected microbial
              species at anticipated abundances, with the limit of detection
              for the lowest abundance species below 50 cells (GridION). De
              novo assembly of metagenomes recovered long contiguous sequences
              without the need for pre-processing techniques such as binning.We
              present ultra-deep, long-read nanopore datasets from a
              well-defined mock community. These datasets will be useful for
              those developing bioinformatics methods for long-read
              metagenomics and for the validation and comparison of current
              laboratory and software pipelines.",
